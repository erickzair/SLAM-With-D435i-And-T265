1. If you have the problem:

CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ddynamic_reconfigure" with any of the following names:

    ddynamic_reconfigureConfig.cmake
    ddynamic_reconfigure-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ddynamic_reconfigure" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "ddynamic_reconfigure_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "ddynamic_reconfigure" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

You can solve this with the next line in terminal:

sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-ddynamic-reconfigure

And if you are using another version of ROS you can try to change the version word, for example:

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ddynamic-reconfigure


2. To resolve issue:
 
Using realsense d435i ubuntu 18.04 and ros melodic, if you can see the image in realsense-viewer but you can't see any on rviz and present the next msg:

23/04 18:13:47,017 WARNING [140493716674304] (messenger-libusb.cpp:42) control_transfer returned error, index: 768, error: Resource temporarily unavailable, number: 11

You can solve it changing the <arg name="pointcloud_texture_stream" default="RS_STREAM_COLOR"/> for <arg name="pointcloud_texture_stream" default="RS_STREAM_ANY"/>

in the directory:
/opt/ros/melodic/share/realsense2_camera/launch/rs_camera.launch

Second ticket:
